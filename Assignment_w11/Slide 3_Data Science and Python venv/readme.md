2. Data Science is the field of study that combines mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data.

  In simple terms, data science involves:

  * Collecting and storing data

  * Cleaning and preparing it
  
  * Analyzing it using algorithms and models

  * Visualizing results and

  * Communicating findings to support decisions

It powers applications like predictive analytics, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and AI development across many industries. The main goal of data science is to turn raw data into useful knowledge.

3. Data refers to raw facts, numbers, or observations that have not yet been processed or analyzedâ€”for example, a list of temperatures or customer transactions. Data science is the field that focuses on analyzing and interpreting this data using mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights and solve problems. A data scientist is a professional who applies data science techniques to real-world data; they collect, clean, analyze, and model data, then communicate findings to help organizations make informed decisions. In short, data is the raw material, data science is the process, and the data scientist is the expert who carries it out.
